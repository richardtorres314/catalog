## About ##

This release of Lorem Ipsum's Course Catalog has several key features. 
Far from being complete, there are several features I would like to 
implement in future iterations.

### Key Features ###

- Search by department, course group, term, faculty, and day
- Responsive select fields
- Output to PDF, XML, and JSON

### To Do ###

- Add keyword search
- Add time of day search
- Add styling for different mediatypes
- Limit page-navbar from overflow
